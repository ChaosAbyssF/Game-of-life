# Game of life

Well this is a simple webpage to present Conway's Game of Life.

Made by vite so make sure you have already had nodejs installed.

```cmd
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then you may see the game.

## settings

I have set the update time to 1.5s, so you may see the page update every 1.5s as an iteration.

Basicly i simply use the for loop to check every block in the page, which can be slow. Probably using hash map will have a better performance, but i'm too lazy :)

So don't mind change the settings with your own algorithm and time intervals and have fun with it.
